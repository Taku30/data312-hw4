**Author:** Taku Takahashi
**Course:** DATA 312 – Data Visualization with R
**Semester:** Spring 2025

## 📝 Overview

This project is a hands-on assignment created as part of Homework 2 for American University's Data312 class. The goal was to practice:

- Data visualization using **ggplot2**
- Document formatting and reproducibility using **Quarto**
- Rendering and sharing R-based analysis as **HTML reports**

The work was completed in a `.qmd` (Quarto) file and rendered to HTML.

## 📊 Topics Covered

Each task demonstrates a specific skill:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | Load `tidyverse` and access the built-in `diamonds` dataset |
| 2    | Preview the dataset using `head()` and `glimpse()` |
| 3    | Create a basic scatter plot with `ggplot()` |
| 4    | Interpret plot results (carat vs. price) |
| 5    | Create a bar plot of diamond cuts |
| 6    | Load and explore the `mpg` dataset |
| 7    | Boxplot: city mileage vs. car class |
| 8    | Interpretation of median city mileage |
| 9    | Boxplot: highway mileage vs. manufacturer |
| 10   | Line plot: unemployment trends using `economics` data |
